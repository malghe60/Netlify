There will be times while we working in Data Science where you will want to vizualize the output of Data in Class, we worked on making scatter plots in Rstudio, running a query searching for players with at least 400 career homeruns.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR ,sum(SO) AS career_SO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"
result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=3, color="green")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts vs. Homeruns for Great Hitter")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
